# Loom
A Language Running on top of python. Made for Fun and Learning. 

`Run python main.py for the usage`

*example contains `rule110.loom` proving it is turing complete.

I have stopped working on this project as the implementation is 18x slower than python (Due to pyexp and pycall... Also my way of parsing) as expected. I will start working on a new project called L3 (Low Level Loom) which will be a compiled language (complies to nasm). Also I am working on another implementation of the same in Java L2B(It is the same without any dependancy like pyexp, pycall etc.,). You can find L2B repo in my profile :+1:.
