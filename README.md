# Loom
A Language Running on top of python. Made for Fun and Learning. 

`Run python main.py for the usage`

*example contains `rule110.loom` proving it is turing complete.

I have stopped working on this project as the implementation is 18x slower than python (Due to pyexp and pycall) as expected. I will start working on a new project called L3 (Low Level Loom) which will be a compiled language (complies to nasm).
